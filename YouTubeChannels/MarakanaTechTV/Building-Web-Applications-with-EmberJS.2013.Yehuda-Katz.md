> by, Yehuda Katz (HTML5DevConf 2013)

[emberjs](http://emberjs.com/)

### MVC on WebPages

```
[This]          |   [Deals with data for]
Model           |   All Sessions
Controller      |   Just this session
Template/View   |   What is currently visible
```

* Models shouldn't get nuked on View state shift. Unless have an explicit reason to.
* Ember is HTML; doesn't try to replace but add
* URLs shall be changing in URL-Bar with location on WebApp; else no sharing
