### 1. Pods

* smallest deployable unit

* small group of tightly coupled containers

* shared network and data volumes

* routable IP address

* mortal! (no guranatee they will live where they are born)

---

> to handle Pods

### 2. ReplicaSets

* run x copies of pod

* start or kill pods on need

* handle pod failres with health-checks

---

> to handle ReplicaSets

### 3. Deployments

* contains declaration of your application like container, env-vars, data-vols

* defines number of replicas

* creates ReplicaSets

* rolling updates (when edit Deployments)

---

> to make Deployments useful

### 4. Services

* services provide a stable IP/DNS (as pods are mortal)

* proxy traffic to selected pods, from **within cluster**

* simple LB including session affinity

---

> to make Services available to real peopl

### 5. Ingress

* expose services to outside world

* map URLs to Services, provide SSL termination

* needs `ingress provider`

---

> to manage K8s resources well

### 6. Namespaces

* group K8s Resources (like Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, ...)

* by default all belongs to `default` ns, have ns for environments or tenants

* user policies can be placed using Namespaces

* Namespaces can have separate networks (depends on network provider)

---

> to manage all hosts/nodes

### 7. Clusters

* set of virtual/physical machines (nodes) running master and nodes

* cluster federation, involves a `federation master` to know all masters

---

> seperate application-code and configuration

### 8. Secrets and ConfigMaps

* use `Secrets` for binary values (e.g. certs,keys) and `ConfigMaps` for string values

* both of these are Key-Val pairs, can be read by container via env-variables or mapped into a data-volume e.g. like property files

---

> share data among containers

### 9. Data Volumes

* map directories into containers, many volume types (empty dir, host dir, Google Disk, Amazon Blob Store, NFS, GlusterFS, RDB, Cephs, Git,...)

* can be pre-configured by cluster admins for easier usage by  cluster users

---

> stateful pod

### 10. PetSets

* has a scalable number of Pets

* its bound to a dynamically created Data Volumes (which will never be deleted), Pet is bound to same volume on restart

---

> to run short running tasks

### 11. Jobs

* a Job ensures that a container which executes a task to run successfully once, retry on failure

* ScheduledJobs can be started used like Cron

---

> run Pods on all (or selected nodes in Clusters)

### 12. DaemonSets

* useful for running logging/monitoring/service-discovery/blah containers

---

> so service is always performant

### 13. AutoScaling

* Horizontal Pod AutoScaling; scales ReplicaSets based on Pod's CPU usage or app-provided metrics

* Cluster AutoScaling, scale number of nodes in your cluster based on CPU/mem usage (based on Cloud Proivder)

---

> extend upon easily

### 14. API

* REST API for every functionality, used in tools like `kubectl`

---

> so everyone feels at ease

### 15. Community!

* [k8s slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/)
