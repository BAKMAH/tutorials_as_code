; intro to vectors
; Vectors can be constructed several ways. You can compare them with lists.
; (= [__] (list :a :b :c) (vec '(:a :b :c)) (vector :a :b :c))
;(println (= [:] (list :a :b :c) (vec '(:a :b :c)) (vector :a :b :c)))
(println (= [:a :b :c] (list :a :b :c) (vec '(:a :b :c)) (vector :a :b :c)))
