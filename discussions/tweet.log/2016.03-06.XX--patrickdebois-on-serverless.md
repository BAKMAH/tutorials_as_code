> @patrickdebois so of course there are servers but people don’t consider the word server have many meanings. A daemon is a server too
> @patrickdebois yeah. I always thought of them in terms of attack vector (not just security but general bugs and risk of change)
> @patrickdebois what’s stupidly called serverless massively reduce that surface by well reducing you overall surface of exposure
> @patrickdebois far daemon based systems have a lot of that - and maintenance cost is an attack too.

> is there an easy way to work with wildcard aws API Gateway mappings? have 1 function handle multiple routes (CRUD)

@brianleroux May 30
> @patrickdebois feel this is likely an anti pattern .. your lambda now needs routing logic; better to break out into discreet lambdas
> @patrickdebois even better still now reads and writes are isolated this way
> @patrickdebois we started there (which is probably good) and refactored out after it became apparent we were reimplementing API Gateway
