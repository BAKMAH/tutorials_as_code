> @patrickdebois easy. Ttl is super short <1 day, so everything can live in ram. Trash everything else

> @patrickdebois I mean, I don't want to diminish the achievement, but they don't need to worry about deep caching levels

patrickdebois @patrickdebois  7h7 hours ago
> @wrossmck if not cached isn't it even harder to achieve? slow network and still feels instant

Ross McKinley @wrossmck  7h7 hours ago Dublin City, Ireland
> @patrickdebois sorry I mean they don't need to worry about old data. So there's no need to cache frequently accessed vids a la YouTube

> @patrickdebois they do pre-loading because they know you can't skip backwards, only forwards. Time to watch one clip is enough to pod a few

patrickdebois @patrickdebois  7h7 hours ago
> @wrossmck true , still different for snapchat discover, but that indeed could be preloaded

Ross McKinley @wrossmck  7h7 hours ago Dublin City, Ireland
> @patrickdebois I'd say so. Just thinking about it now and would love to see what they're actually doing.
