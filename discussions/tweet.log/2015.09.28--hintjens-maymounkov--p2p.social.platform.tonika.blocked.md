> @maymounkov heard old #FLOSS netcast on #Tonika, examples on moral need of P2P based systems were amazing; is project still active

Petar Maymounkov @maymounkov  28 Sep 2015
> @abionic Not active at the moment. Trying to find ways to fund and/or organize the development of Tonika.

> @maymounkov is http://github.com/petar/tonika  current state there is; I'll try look at code; is it possible to post/add some design & MVP details

> @abionic Writing an architecture doc would probably make sense. I need to think and plan this. It makes sense.

Petar Maymounkov @maymounkov  28 Sep 2015
> @abionic This has an old proof-of-concept code. The code doesn’t compile mainly because it was made for an early Go.

> @abionic Tonika is blocked on one big issue: No working libraries for P2P connections through firewalls (for Go).

Can start looking into P2P & Firewall (1of2)

~=ABK=~ @abionic  28 Sep 2015
> @maymounkov f/w shall have some port burns at least; can we assume at least strictly HTTP traffic allowed (2of2)

Petar Maymounkov @maymounkov  28 Sep 2015
> @abionic I think the only general solution is: (1) reliable transport over UDP, and (2) two-sided firewall punch using UDP

~=ABK=~ @abionic  28 Sep 2015
> @maymounkov asked for HTTP as thought something like https://webtorrent.io  + workers for crypto might escape blockers a lot easier

~=ABK=~ @abionic  28 Sep 2015
> @maymounkov do you think sth. like 0MQ Request/Response over UDP could help (/cc @hintjens); also if 0MQ PGM might fit any usecase

Pieter Hintjens @hintjens  28 Sep 2015
> @abionic @maymounkov ZeroMQ won't help as such. You need a magic transport that does (1) and (2)...

It would be sane to start a UDP/p2p transport project in ZeroMQ

> @hintjens thanks... will take a look, need to read/refresh for clarity /cc @maymounkov )
