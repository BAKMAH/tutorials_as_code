/*
Rust is an expression based language with just two types of statements. Declaration and Expression statements.
`let` can only begin a statement not an expression.
let x = (let y = 5); // ERRONEOUS

Here value of an assignment is an empty tuple as assigned value can have just one owner.
let mut y = 5;
let x = (y = 7); //makes y =7 and x =()

Expression statement turns any expression to a statement. Semicolon separated expressions.
