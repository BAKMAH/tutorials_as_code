## Which Way Is Forward
> by Douglas Crockford

* Goto removal war story

* bug story

* work on JS performance

---

#### Proof of Correctness

* Tests can only prove the existence of bugs, not absence of all.

* Using "Types". What do the bits mean?
> Robin Milner(1978) : "Well typed programs cannot go wrong."
> But it's False. He wasn't able to prove, just theory... but madde base of most type-wars.
> Will static typing ever be worth the freight?

#### Classical Inheritance vs. Prototypal Inheritance

* Prototypal doesn't need Classification, Taxonomy
* Prototypal (used in JS); better idea in 1995 as memory conservation, retroactive heredity, confusing(own property vs inherited), performance inhibiting

new statement
* 'class free' is better approach

#### Functional Programming

1958 LISP
* Simula (first time use of Classes) inspiring SmallTalk
1973 ML (Milner)
1975 Scheme
1984 Common Lisp
1990 Haskell
1999 Javascript
