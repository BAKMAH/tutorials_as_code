```Linux since 2.6.x ```
* Completely Fair Scheduler
  > * stores record of planned tasks in red-black-tree(BinSearch Auto-Balanced) by spent-time key
  > * allows it to pick the proc that has utilized CPU for least time

``` FreeBSD, Solaris Mac```
* Multilevel Feedback Queue

#### Instruction/Data mapping to Memory Address have 3 ways
> knows at compile time where the process will reside
  * Compile Time : can create the absolute code
  * Load Time : can create re-locatable code
> program can be moved around in memory
* Execution Time : binding delayed to run-time
