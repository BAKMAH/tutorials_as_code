### Type of Platforms running O.S. [ Hardware Based ]
* Desktop/Laptop
* MobilePhones/Tablets
* Embedded
* Rack-Mounted Servers
* Virtual Machines

### Basic Info. of
* Monolithic Kernel, MicroKernel, HybridKernel
* Kernel Mode, User Mode
* Loadable Kernel Modules, their Security concern, Disable dynamic loading post-boot

### How a typical system Boots up
```ASCII
PowerUp
    \/
Instruction Register (in CPU; told to run Firmware)
    \/
Firmware (BIOS -or- UEFI; POST and then told to load Bootloader)
    \/
Bootloader (load the O.S.)
    \/
Kernel
    \/
KernelModules (DeviceDrivers,...)
    \/
Initial UserMode Service (for linux: init -or- upstart -or- openrc -or- systemd)
```

### Few of the Types of O.S.:
* Time Sharing O.S.
* Real-Time O.S.

### Basics on Process Management
* SingleTasking AND MultiTasking (MultiProgramming, TimeSharing)
* SingleProcessor AND MultiProcessor (MultiChip, MultiCore)

### What's an O.S.
* middleman to control, procure, secure... the reusable engine to control hardware resource for user applications
* kernel modules: system calls, bus drivers, executable formats, i/o streams, scheduling algorithms, file systems, device drivers, miscellaneous
* handles managing: Process, Memory, Files, Device, Security, SysPerf, Job A/c, Errors, System Interface to Users
