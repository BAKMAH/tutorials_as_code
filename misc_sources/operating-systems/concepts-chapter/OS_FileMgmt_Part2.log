// DMA

* DeviceDriver gets told to transfer disk data to buffer space
* DeviceDriver instructs DiskController to start transfer
* DiskController Starts DMA transfer, sending each byte to DMA controller
* DMA Controller places it to buffer, increase mem-block pointer and decrease counter
* When Counter is over; DMA interrupts CPU to signal transfer completion

//os on raid
// drivers
// raid z parity
#### RAID (Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks) Structure
... reliability via redundancy, performance via parallelism (block-level, bit-level)
> RAID 0 : non-redundant block-level stripping
> RAID 1 : mirrored disks
> RAID 2 : memory style error correcting codes, bit stripping with Hamming-Code-Parity; more theoretical
> > Hamming [ p1 => p2 => d1 => p3 => d2 => d3 => d4 ] Here, p1.covers(d1,d2,d4); p2.covers(d1,d3,d4) ; p3.covers(d2,d3,d4)
> RAID 3 : bit-interleaved dedicated parity; 
> RAID 4 : block-interleaved dedicated parity;
> RAID 5 : block-interleaved distributed parity;
> RAID 6 : P + Q redundancy; P XORd AND Q linear-feedback-Shift-XORd

> RAID 7 : registered trademark of Storage Comp.Corp. ; RAID 3 with O.S. to cache data and manage speed
> RAID S : by EMC, H/w producing parity info so faster 
> RAID Z : ZFS based RAID 5 with varied size stripe, closely couple with OS and H/w so both from Sun(Oracle)

...nested RAID levels
> RAID 1+0 : Striping and Mirroring; ideal for mission critical
> RAID 5+0 : RAID 5 Striped in RAID 0 for performance gain
> RAID 5+3 : in practice is RAID 3+0
