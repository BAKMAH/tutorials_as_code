## Disk/File Management

#### Disk H/w
> coated platters => surface => track => sector
> all sectors same size, outer tracks more sectors than inner

> Process of getting to particular bit to R/W data involves
* correct head selection
* seeking of distance from center   } seek latency
* rotate to required spot of bit    } rotational latency
* handling actual r/w task via DMA

> can only r/w from disk in blocks

> Controller

> Daisy Chain arrangement
> accessed via I/o Ports or RemoteHost
> I/O Port consists of Status Register; Control Register; Data-in Register; Data-out Register

> Polling : host waits for controller response in loop checking Status Reg's busy bit

> Interrupts : catch, dispatch, clear
> * need ability to defer interrupt handling during critical processing
> * need efficient way to dispatch to proper interrupt handler for device, w/o polling all => Interrupt Vector Table
> * need interrupt priority levels so OS can distinguish

> Direct Mem Access :
> * wasteful for CPU to keep checking status bits & feed data into controller register a byte a time
> * offload Programmed I/o workload to DMA
> * DMA is told Source, Destination and number of Bytes to transfer

#### Disk Scheduling

FCFS is bad mostly for Disk Queues due to dynamic location points. Better algorithms:
> Shortest Seek Time First
> * choose request closest to current head position BUT arbitrarily long starvation
> The Elevator (SCAN/LOOK) Algorithm
> * serving closest requirement in progressing direction BUT same cylinder request lead starvation
> One-way Elevator (C-SCAN/LOOK) Algorithm
> * no favoritism for middle tracks

SSDs have uniform service read time but not write time. So read in FCFS. Though merge adjacent write requests.

// DMA

* DeviceDriver gets told to transfer disk data to buffer space
* DeviceDriver instructs DiskController to start transfer
* DiskController Starts DMA transfer, sending each byte to DMA controller
* DMA Controller places it to buffer, increase mem-block pointer and decrease counter
* When Counter is over; DMA interrupts CPU to signal transfer completion

#### RAID (Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks) Structure
... reliability via redundancy, performance via parallelism (block-level, bit-level)
> RAID 0 : non-redundant block-level stripping
> RAID 1 : mirrored disks
> RAID 2 : memory style error correcting codes, bit stripping with Hamming-Code-Parity; more theoretical
> > Hamming [ p1 => p2 => d1 => p3 => d2 => d3 => d4 ] Here, p1.covers(d1,d2,d4); p2.covers(d1,d3,d4) ; p3.covers(d2,d3,d4)
> RAID 3 : bit-interleaved dedicated parity; 
> RAID 4 : block-interleaved dedicated parity;
> RAID 5 : block-interleaved distributed parity;
> RAID 6 : P + Q redundancy; P XORd AND Q linear-feedback-Shift-XORd

> RAID 7 : registered trademark of Storage Comp.Corp. ; RAID 3 with O.S. to cache data and manage speed
> RAID S : by EMC, H/w producing parity info so faster 
> RAID Z : ZFS based RAID 5 with varied size stripe, closely couple with OS and H/w so both from Sun(Oracle)
